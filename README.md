You can call this project "Schedule Helper" in English or "Aufgaben Helfer" in German, of cos "定时助手" in Chinese.  Use this application you can schedule many tasks like change your ringtone to mute, vibrate or sound. Some more tasks like close Wifi, Mobile Network etc have also been added.  There're 3 different modes "Hungry", "Thirsty", "Neutral" for different status of devices. More features and functionalities are going to be added almost on every day.  

 - Hungry: For charging or full battery status by using [ACTION_TIME_TICK](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_TIME_TICK).
 - Thirsty: For Android 4.4.X users it is the best alternative by using [AlarmManager](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html).
 - Neutral: All devices under 4.4.x could use this mode to achieve best scheduled user-feelings by using [AlarmManager](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html).
